  # For simplicity, keep this lookup as narrow as possible
  # Hiera uses layers of configuration. 
  # Each layer has its own hierarchy, and they’re linked into one super-hierarchy before doing a lookup.
  # This configuration file provides layers searched in the following order: global → os → datacenter -> environment -> node 
  # Hiera searches every data source in the global layer’s hierarchy before checking any source in the os layer.
  # Production branch example for puppet client: node123.glblblue.ad.pwcinternal.com  results in the following lookup tree:
  # /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/data/common.yaml
  # /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/data/RedHat.yaml
  # /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/data/glblblue.ad.pwcinternal.com.yaml
  # /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/data/datacenter/common.yaml
  # /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/data/environment/common.yaml
  # /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/data/nodes/node123.yaml
  
  # Therefore if you want to configure a node specific setting without affecting any other node, 
  # then modify the node123.yaml file accordingly
